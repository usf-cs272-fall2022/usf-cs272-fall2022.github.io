## Lecture Sections

Lectures will be conducted in-person by the instructor. The lectures will be recorded and may be viewed asynchronously by students within 48 hours. Students may also attend synchronously via Zoom as a non-interactive backup option if temporarily unable to make it to class in person. The lecture sections and details are:

| Section | Date/Time | Location | Zoom Meeting |
|:--------|:----------|:-------------|
| CS 272-01 Lecture | Tue/Thu 12:45-2:30p | Lo Schiavo G12 | [{{ site.data.info.streams.lectures.room }}]({{ site.data.info.streams.lectures.link }}) |
| CS 272-02 Lecture | Tue/Thu 04:35-6:20p | Lo Schiavo G12 | [{{ site.data.info.streams.lectures.room }}]({{ site.data.info.streams.lectures.link }}) |
{: class="table is-hoverable" style="width: auto;" }

Students must attend their enrolled lecture section for exams, unless otherwise approved  by the instructor. Room permitting, students may attend either lecture section (offered by the same instructor) on non-exam days.

Students must attend a lecture section offered by the same instructor as their lab section.

## Lab Sessions

Labs will be conducted in-person by the instructor during the first several weeks of class. During this time, students must attend their enrolled section in-person; labs are not always recorded or available via Zoom. 

| Section | Date/Time | Location |
|:--------|:----------|:-------------|
| CS 272L-01 Lab    | Fri 12:45-1:50p | Lo Schiavo G12 |
| CS 272L-02 Lab    | Fri 2:00-3:05p | Lo Schiavo G12 |
{: class="table is-hoverable" style="width: auto;" }

After several weeks, the lab sessions transition to one-on-one code reviews with the instructor and optional help sessions led by the teacher assistants. Students may attend either lab section (or both) at that time.

Students must enroll in and attend a lab section taught by the same instructor as their lecture section.
